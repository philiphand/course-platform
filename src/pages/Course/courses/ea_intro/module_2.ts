    title: "The ITN framework",
    type: "text",
    introduction: [
      "What is the best way to find cost-effective interventions to improve the world? Nobody has yet found a perfect way to go about this, but the EA community often uses a method known as the ITN framework. ITN is an abbreviation for importance, neglectedness, and tractability, which are the three factors the framework considers to prioritize global cause areas.",
      "Very roughly speaking, importance stands for the scale and severity of the problem, while neglectedness stands for the amount of attention and resources it has received, and tractability stands for how much progress we can expect to make if we invest a certain amount of resources into it. Weighing these three factors together may help us identify cost-effective interventions that are likely to have the greatest impact.",
      "The following article explains how Open Philanthropy uses the ITN framework to prioritize different causes. Open Philanthropy is a non-profit organization that works to strategically allocate resources to the most effective causes and interventions. They also do independent research to find the most cost-effective interventions and support them accordingly."

    title: "Fermi estimates",
    introduction: [
      "Fermi estimates are about making rough estimates about quantities that are difficult to measure. For example, the exact number of people in a city or stars in the sky at a given time. In both of these cases it would be nearly impossible to come up with an exact number.",
      "However, by using a few basic assumptions and some simple math, it is often possible to come up with a reasonable estimate of the quantity in question. Instead of simply guessing or following our intuition, it may be more rational to make a rough and inaccurate estimate to aid our decision-making.",
      "Fermi estimates can help us estimate the cost-effectiveness different interventions to improve the world. They are therefore very useful in the context of cause prioritization and deciding where to allocate our resources."

    title: "Expected value",
    introduction: [
      "This section introduces the concept of expected value. The expected value of en event is defined as the probability of the event multiplied by the value of the event if it occurs. Because the world is highly unpredictable, expected value calculations are commonly used in cost-effectiveness analysis for uncertain events where the probability is less than 100%."

    introduction: [
      "The following article shows an attempt at estimating the cost of saving a life. This example estimate is from a cost-effectiveness analysis done by the charity evaluator GiveWell. A charity evaluator is an organization that evaluates charities and provides recommendations for donors. GiveWell separates itself from other charity evaluators by emphasizing evidence and certainty of positive outcomes when ranking charity interventions."
